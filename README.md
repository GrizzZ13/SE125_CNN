This is a simple CNN image classifier for SE125, SJTU

You may refer to file **LabReport.pdf** to read the report.

Run `elexnet.py` and `resnet.py` to train brand new models.

Run `test.py` to test the pre-trained model on Cifar-10 test set.

Note : You may need to download Cifar-10 data set at first, which takes quite a lot of time without special methods to accelerate your network :(
